# SystemProgramming1
Tasks:
The Chapter 2 lecture slides describe a program that copies contents of one file to a destination file. It first prompts the user for the name of the source and destination files. Write this program in C or Java. Make sure that the program includes all necessary error checking (e.g. that the source file exists, etc.).

Once you have written and tested the program, run the program using a utility that traces system calls. Linux systems provide the strace utility whereas Solaris and Mac OS have the dtrace utility. On Windows, you will have to trace the program using a debugger or your IDE.
